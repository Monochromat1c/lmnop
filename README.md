# Special Message Project

This is a simple, static website designed to display a special, personalized message to a specific user.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application. It contains the welcome message, a simple sign-in form, and the main message content that is revealed after successful sign-in.
- `src/pages/cancel-page.html`: A page displayed if the user chooses not to proceed to the message.
- `src/audio/bgm.mp3`: Background music for the website.
- `src/images/pin.png`: An image asset used in the design.

## Features

- **Personalized Welcome:** A landing modal greets the user.
- **Simple Sign-In:** A basic sign-in mechanism to ensure the message is read by the intended recipient.
- **Typewriter Effect:** The main message is displayed with a typewriter effect for a more engaging experience.
- **Background Music:** The site includes background music that plays upon user interaction.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to work on different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

## How to View
